# Apache Virtual Host on CentOS 10 Stream

This project demonstrates how I hosted a static webpage using Apache's virtual host on CentOS 10 Stream.

## ðŸ§© Key Highlights:
- Apache installation and config on CentOS Stream 10
- Custom creation of `httpd-vhost.conf` (since not available by default)
- Defined `ServerName`, `DocumentRoot`, and `ServerAlias`
- Mapped `test.local` in `/etc/hosts`
- Fixed SELinux and Firewall permissions
- Successfully hosted and rendered `index.html`

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- httpd-vhost.conf
- Screenshot of browser (test.local)
- Screenshot of terminal (configtest + success)
